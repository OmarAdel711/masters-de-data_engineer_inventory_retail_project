# End-to-End Retail Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting Solution Using Azure Data Pipelines and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project addresses a business need by building a comprehensive data pipeline on Azure, focusing on retail inventory management and demand forecasting. The objective is to extract customer and sales data from an on-premises SQL database, transform it in the cloud, and use machine learning to forecast inventory demand. The pipeline's insights enable stakeholders to track inventory and anticipate demand changes, ensuring efficient stock management. The final deployment includes a forecasting model accessible via a web interface, with fully automated daily updates.

## Business Requirements
The business aims to better understand inventory demand and optimize stock levels by analyzing historical sales and inventory data. Key requirements include:
- **Demand Forecasting**: Implement machine learning models to forecast future inventory demand.
- **Inventory and Sales Reporting**: Provide detailed reports on product sales and inventory levels, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Deploy an easy-to-use web-based interface for accessing forecasting results.

## Solution Overview
To meet the business requirements, the solution is structured into the following components:

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Extract customer, sales, and inventory data from an on-premises SQL Server database.
- Use Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load the data into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).

### 2. Data Transformation
- Use Azure Databricks to clean and transform the data.
- Organize the data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, with raw data in the Bronze layer, cleaned data in Silver, and aggregated, analysis-ready data in Gold.

### 3. Forecasting and Analysis
- Build demand forecasting models using Python (Statsmodels, Scikit-learn) in Azure Databricks.
- Utilize time series models like ARIMA or ARMA to predict future inventory demand.
- Load the transformed and forecasted data into Azure Synapse Analytics for further analysis and storage.

### 4. Data Loading and Reporting
- Set up a data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics to store aggregated data.
- Use the warehouse for reporting and querying purposes.

### 5. Deployment and Web Interface
- Deploy the forecasting model as a web service using Python frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.
- Allow stakeholders to interact with the forecasts through a user-friendly web dashboard for inventory management and reporting.

### 6. Automation and Monitoring
- Schedule the entire pipeline to run daily using ADF, ensuring that data and forecasts are always up-to-date.
- Monitor the pipeline's performance using ADF and Synapse monitoring tools.

### 7. MLOps and Model Management
- Implement MLOps using MLflow to track, manage, and deploy forecasting models.
- Ensure continuous model performance tracking and automated updates.

## Technology Stack
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For orchestrating data movement and transformation.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: For storing raw and processed data.
- **Azure Databricks**: For data transformation, forecasting, and analysis.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For data warehousing and SQL-based analytics.
- **Azure Machine Learning & MLflow**: For building, managing, and deploying forecasting models.
- **Python (Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)**: For demand forecasting models.
- **Flask/Streamlit**: For deploying a web-based interface for interacting with forecasts.
- **SQL Server (On-Premises)**: Source of customer and sales data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- An Azure account with sufficient credits.
- Access to an on-premises SQL Server database.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Azure Environment Setup**
- Create a resource group and provision necessary services: Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Databricks workspace, and Synapse Analytics.
- Set up Azure Key Vault for secure secret management.

**Step 2: Data Ingestion**
- Use ADF pipelines to extract data from the SQL database and load it into the Bronze layer of ADLS.

**Step 3: Data Transformation**
- Clean and transform data in Azure Databricks, moving it from the Bronze to Silver, and finally to the Gold layer in ADLS.

**Step 4: Forecasting and Analysis**
- Build demand forecasting models in Azure Databricks, leveraging Python libraries like Statsmodels.
- Evaluate model performance and adjust parameters accordingly.

**Step 5: Data Loading and Reporting**
- Load the transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for reporting and querying.

**Step 6: Deployment and Web Interface**
- Deploy the forecasting model using Flask or Streamlit, providing stakeholders with access to the model results via a web dashboard.

**Step 7: Automation and Monitoring**
- Use ADF to automate the pipeline, ensuring daily data and forecast updates.
- Monitor pipeline runs using ADF and Synapse's built-in monitoring tools.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for retail inventory management, incorporating machine learning for demand forecasting. By leveraging Azure's data services, the pipeline ensures stakeholders have access to up-to-date inventory predictions, helping them make data-driven decisions.
