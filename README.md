# End-to-End Retail Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting Solution Using Azure Data Pipelines and Machine Learning


## Project Overview
This project addresses a business need by building a comprehensive data pipeline on Azure, focusing on retail inventory management and demand forecasting. The objective was to extract customer and sales data from an on-premises SQL database, transform it in the cloud, and use machine learning to forecast inventory demand. The pipeline's insights enabled stakeholders to track inventory and anticipate demand changes, ensuring efficient stock management. The project concluded with the development of a forecasting model in Azure Databricks, integrated with MLflow for model management. Visualization of the forecasting results was provided through the Databricks notebook.

## Business Requirements
The business aimed to better understand inventory demand and optimize stock levels by analyzing historical sales and inventory data. Key requirements included:
- **Demand Forecasting**: Implement machine learning models to forecast future inventory demand.
- **Inventory and Sales Reporting**: Provide detailed reports on product sales and inventory levels, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Present forecasting results through visualizations directly in the Databricks environment.

## Solution Overview
The solution was structured into the following components:

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Extract customer, sales, and inventory data from an on-premises SQL Server database.
- Use Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load the data into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).

### 2. Data Transformation
- Use Azure Databricks to clean and transform the data.
- Organize the data into **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers: 
  - **Bronze**: Raw data
  - **Silver**: Cleaned data
  - **Gold**: Aggregated, analysis-ready data.

### 3. Forecasting and Analysis
- Build demand forecasting models using Python (Statsmodels, Scikit-learn) in Azure Databricks.
- Utilize time series models like ARIMA or ARMA to predict future inventory demand.
- Integrate MLflow in Databricks for model tracking, management, and deployment.
- Visualize the forecasting results directly in the Databricks notebook for stakeholder review.

### 4. Data Loading and Reporting
- Set up a data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics to store aggregated data.
- Use the warehouse for reporting and querying purposes.

### 5. Deployment and Web Interface (Optional)
- The forecasting model can be deployed as a web service using Python frameworks like Flask or Streamlit, allowing stakeholders to interact with the forecasts. However, in this project, visualizations were presented in the Databricks notebook for simplicity.

### 6. Automation and Monitoring
- Schedule the entire pipeline to run daily using ADF, ensuring that data and forecasts are always up-to-date.
- Monitor the pipeline's performance using ADF and Synapse monitoring tools.

### 7. MLOps and Model Management
- Implement MLOps using MLflow within Databricks to track, manage, and deploy forecasting models.
- Ensure continuous model performance tracking and automated updates through MLflow.

## Technology Stack
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For orchestrating data movement and transformation.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: For storing raw and processed data.
- **Azure Databricks**: For data transformation, forecasting, and visualization.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For data warehousing and SQL-based analytics.
- **Azure Machine Learning & MLflow**: For building, managing, and deploying forecasting models.
- **Python (Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)**: For demand forecasting models.
- **SQL Server (On-Premises)**: Source of customer and sales data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- An Azure account with sufficient credits.
- Access to an on-premises SQL Server database.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Azure Environment Setup

#### 2. Data Ingestion
- Use ADF pipelines to extract data from the SQL database and load it into the Bronze layer of ADLS.

#### 3. Data Transformation
- Clean and transform data in Azure Databricks, moving it from the Bronze to Silver, and finally to the Gold layer in ADLS.

#### 4. Forecasting and Analysis
- Build demand forecasting models in Azure Databricks, leveraging Python libraries like Statsmodels.
- Integrate MLflow for tracking and managing models.
- Visualize the forecasting results directly within Databricks.

#### 5. Data Loading and Reporting
- Load the transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for reporting and querying.

#### 6. Automation and Monitoring
- Use ADF to automate the pipeline, ensuring daily data and forecast updates.
- Monitor pipeline runs using ADF and Synapse's built-in monitoring tools.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for retail inventory management, incorporating machine learning for demand forecasting. By leveraging Azure's data services, the pipeline ensures stakeholders have access to up-to-date inventory predictions, helping them make data-driven decisions. The project concluded with an MLflow-integrated forecasting model, visualized in Azure Databricks notebooks for efficient stock management.
